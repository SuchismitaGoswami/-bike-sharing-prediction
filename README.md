# bike-sharing-prediction

Prediction of bike sharing Project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

# Project Overview

In this project, I built a simple neural network from scratch to predict daily bike rental ridership! 
The core data set is related to the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012.
